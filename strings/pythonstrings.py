MongoDB provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability because it is a cross-platform, document-oriented database. To adopt JSON-like documents which have BSON (dynamic schemes) MongoDB shuns the relational databaseâ€™s table-based structure, which makes data integration for certain types of applications faster and easier."""
